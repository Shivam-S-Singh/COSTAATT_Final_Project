## The Application of DevOps in Campus Area Networks

This is a practical exercise to address common challenges faced in computer networking that can be solved by utilizing software engineering concepts and tools originally intended to streamline the production and management of code.

Common Issues faced in Network Engineering:
- Inaccurate Documentation
- Production network as the single source of truth
- Configuration Management
- Testing configuration changes before executing them in Production
- Change management roadblocks

### Building Our Network
We will be doing a greenfield deployment instead of trying to simulate COSTAATT's existing network. The reason I chose to do this is that it will allow me to better showcase the power of some of tools we will be utilizing to complete this project.
With that being said, we need to first design a new network. If you would like the nitty gritty details behind my design choices you can reference the Project Proposal Document.

The tools that were utilized in the design of the network were Draw.IO and NetBox.


Below is a high level diagram of what our network will look like. This is a 3-Tier network

While we are not working with physical devices, below serves as a reference to what the devices would look like on a switch rack. The devices chosen were based on its relation to the network OS software that will run in GNS3.
